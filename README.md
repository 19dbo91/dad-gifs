I think mine was more a Fanta sea. Just like our web app!

Don't you ever wonder:

- "Gosh, I wish this Dad Joke had a gif to go with it..."
- "Wouldn't it be so cool if I could share this gif with some dad joke to go with it?"
- "How do I work this thing?"

...Neither do we! But with our new and improved Dad-Gif app, now no-one will have those problems!
